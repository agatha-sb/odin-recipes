  <h2>Description</h2>

  
   
  <p>Ras malai or rossomalai (Bengali: রসমালাই) or Rasamalei (Odia: ରସମଲେଇ) is a dessert originating from the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent. The dessert is called rossomalai in Bengali, ras malai in Hindi, and Rasa Malei in Odia.</p>
  <p>Though ras malai is made in different places, of them Comilla District in Bangladesh and Kolkata in the Indian state of West Bengal are known prominently.</p>
  <p>The sweet may be of Bengali origin; as claimed by K.C. Das Grandsons, it was invented by K.C. Das in Kolkata, but "Impossible to verify". It is also a popular dessert in Pakistan. The Sen brothers of Comilla under the "Matri Bhandar" brand also claim to be the original maker of the dessert. Bangladesh has begun the process of registering geographical indication status for Comillar rasmalai.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Ricotta or cottage cheese from 1 litre of whole milk</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 litre whole milk</li>
    <li>1 /2 tsp saffron + 1/4 tsp granular sugar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cardamom powder</li>
    <li>Almonds & pistachios, soaked,peeled & slivered</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Run the ricotta/cottage cheese in a food processor until smooth. Will take about 2-3 minutes
      in short pulses. You can even knead it by hand, but it will take a lot longer to get it absolutely
      smooth.</li>
    <li>Divide the ricotta /paneer into 10-12 equal portions a little smaller than the size of a ping
      pong ball.</li>
    <li>Roll the portions in your hands until a smooth ball is formed. Lightly press the ball until it
      flattens out.</li>
    <li>In the pressure cooker dissolve 1 cup sugar with water, and add the flattened ricotta / paneer.</li>
    <li>Close pressure cooker lid and cook until one whistle sounds. Immediately switch off the stove
      and set the timer for exactly 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>After 5 minutes, carefully take the pressure cooker to the sink and pour cold water over the
        lid to remove the pressure.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked ricotta /paneer with a slotted spoon into a bowl and allow it to cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, the milk in the non-stick pan should have reduced to half. Add sugar to taste,
          cardamom powder and nuts. Switch off the stove and keep milk aside.</li>
      <li>Once the ricotta /paneer is cool enough to handle with your hands, gently squeeze out the
        sugar syrup from the ricotta / paneer and place the roundels in a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Pour the prepared reduced milk over and chill in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional chopped nuts.</li>
  </ol>
