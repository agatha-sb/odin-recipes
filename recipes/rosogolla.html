  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Rasgulla, also known as Rosogolla, Rosgola, or Rasagola is a South Asian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light sugar syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.
</p>
  <p>The earliest evidence of rasagola can be found in the epic poem Dandi Ramayana which was composed by famous Odia poet Balarama Dasa in which he mentioned that Rasagola is offered to Maa Laxmi by Lord Jagannath in a ritual called Niladri Bije.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Milk - 1/2 litre</li>
    <li>Lemon Juice - 1.5 tbsp (or) Curd - 2 tbsp</li>
    <li>Water - 1 and 3/4 cups water</li>
    <li>Icecubes - 4 to 5</li>
    <li>Sugar - 3/4 cup</li>
    <li>Cardamom powder- A generous pinch</li>
    <li>Pistachios - 3 to 4 chopped finely for garnishing</li>    
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat milk, bring it to boil and simmer it. Take 1.5 tbsp lime juice from a lemon and keep
      it ready.</li>
    <li>When milk starts boiling, add the lemon juice to the boiling milk and stir properly. Stir
      continuosly till the whey water clears and the milk curdles completely. Before adding
      icecubes you can take some whey water which can be reserved for future use which
      is what I did. Now switch off the stove, add ice cubes and allow it to melt completely.</li>
    <li>Take a muslin cloth and pour the curdled milk,filtering the whey water completely.
      Wash it well in running cold water to remove the lemon smell. Squeeze the excess
      water and hang it aside for 30mins without disturbing it.</li>
    <li>After 30mins, the paneer would be crumbly in texture. Now knead it well for 10mins.
      Once everything comes together to a smooth pilable dough, form them into smooth
      mini/normal lemon sized balls and keep aside. I made around 13-15 mini balls.</li>
    <li>Heat water in a wide bottomed vessel, then add sugar and keep stirring till sugar
      dissolves completely. When the sugar syrup boils and starts bubbling, add the balls
      slowly one by one and simmer it for 3mins.</li>
    <li>The balls will go to the corner, move them to the middle. Keep in medium flame and
      close with a lid. Cook for 10mins opening the lid every 3-4 mins this is to ensure the
      vapour passes out not allowing the sugar syrup to ooze out. After 10 mins, the balls
      would be closely doubled in size.</li>
    <li>This is the stage when your rasgullas are done. Cool it completely, add chopped
      pistachios and chill it for an hour and serve chilled. This method was from ammas
      cookbook and I find it easy as you can open and see the rasgullas now and then.</li>
    <li>Though amma kept on saying to try with whey water to make the paneer as that is
      the traditional bengali style of making rasgullas, this time I am completely satisfied
      with the results. But sure to make it once with whey water and update it here with my
      feedback.</li>
